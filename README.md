# Snake Game

A classic Snake game implemented in Java using the Swing library. This project includes core game mechanics, a graphical user interface, and integrated sound effects.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface**: The game features a simple but functional interface with a snake, food items, and a game board.
- **Core Mechanics**: The game includes key functionalities such as snake movement, collision detection, and food generation.
- **Sound Integration**: Background music and sound effects are implemented using the `AudioSystem` class to enhance the gameplay experience.
- **Game States**: The game includes start, pause, and game-over states, with prompts and score tracking.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language for game logic and structure.
- **Swing**: Used for creating the graphical user interface.
- **Timer**: Manages game timing and controls snake movement speed.
- **AudioSystem**: Handles background music and sound effects.
- **ImageIO**: Used to load images for the game interface.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the `SnakeGameDriver` class to start the game.
2. **Controls**:
    - Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
    - Press `Space` to start, pause, or restart the game.
3. **Objective**: Guide the snake to eat the food items. The snake grows longer with each item eaten, and the game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls.
4. **Score**: Your score increases with each food item eaten. The game tracks and displays the highest score achieved.
